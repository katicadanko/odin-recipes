    <h2>Description</h2>

    <p>
      Healthy broccoli cheddar soup packed with carrots, broccoli, garlic, and
      cheese. <br />
      This creamy velvety soup is much better than Paneraâ€™s broccoli cheddar
      soup and can be made in under 30 minutes for a fraction of the price!

        <li>
          Melt butter in a large dutch oven or pot over medium-high heat. Add
          the onion and cook 3-4 minutes or until softened and light gold. Add
          the garlic and saute for another minute.
        </li>
        <li>
          Add flour and whisk for 1-2 minutes or until the flour begins to turn
          golden in color. Pour in the chicken stock, broccoli florets, carrots,
          and seasoning. <br />
          Bring to a boil then reduce heat to medium-low and simmer for 15
          minutes or until the broccoli and carrots are cooked through.
        </li>
        <li>
          Stir in half & half and cheddar cheese and simmer for another minute.
          Taste and adjust seasoning if needed.
